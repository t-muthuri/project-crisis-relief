# crisis - relief

It is famously said that it takes a community to make a change. I hope that it takes an app to empower the community.

Crisis Relief is an app that allows people from all over the world to actively participate in abating the effects of disaster stricken areas. This project proposal is prompted by the ongoing hunger crisis in the ASAL regions of Kenya (2022). The app allows people from any part of the world to donate food, clothes and shelter to the communities adversely affected. It also allows them to offer support to ongoing research and experiments on disaster management i.e. drought-resistant crops, emergency architecture, sustainability among others.

# user story (all characters are fictional)

The help we have received from the community at Crisis-Relief has left my team and me with enough time to reimagine emergency shelters. Since the donations started streaming in, we have been able to build experimental shelters for people living in three highly vulnerable conditions; flood-prone areas, earthquake-stricken regions and war zones. Although our scientific research has seen great advancements, we cannot fail to recognize what Crisis-Relief has done to bring the community together.

# setup

# deliverables

-A well documented readme is the first documentation any developer should use.

Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state. Suggestions for what this can mean: Intuitive, easy to follow layout. Simple yet polished styling. Form field labels where appropriate. Form fields that are validated correctly, and get cleared after submitting. Detailed, well put together readme. No typos. And much more.

Does the project work functionally achieving the expected objectives.

-Commits are made regularly with clear messages associated with them. Atleast 20 commits.

-Your app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized.

-The entire app runs on a single page (only one index.html file) using create-react-app.

-The app has at least 3 client-side routes using react-router.

The app uses a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server.
