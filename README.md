# crisis - relief

It is famously said that it takes a community to make a change. I hope that it takes an app to empower the community.

Crisis Relief is an app that allows people from all over the world to actively participate in abating the effects of disaster stricken areas. This project proposal is prompted by the ongoing hunger crisis in the ASAL regions of Kenya (2022). The app allows people from any part of the world to donate food, clothes and shelter to the communities adversely affected. It also allows them to offer support to ongoing research and experiments on disaster management i.e. drought-resistant crops, emergency architecture, sustainability among others.

# user story (all characters are fictional)

The help I have received from the community at Crisis-Relief has left my team and me with enough time to reimagine emergency shelters. Since the donations started streaming in, we have been able to build experimental shelters for people living in three highly vulnerable conditions; flood-prone areas, earthquake-stricken regions and war zones. Although our scientific research has seen great advancements, we cannot fail to recognize what Crisis-Relief has done to bring the community together.
